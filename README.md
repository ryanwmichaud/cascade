# cascade

Program for any string instrument players. 

Takes notes as input from a text file and outputs a fingering that doesn't use the same string twice, allowing for a cascading waterfall effect
Works with any alternate tuning and any number of strings 

Can also be a powerful study tool as it can give random fingerings for etudes or show every possible fingering superimposed at once
